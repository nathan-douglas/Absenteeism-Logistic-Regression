# Absenteeism-Logistic-Regression

In the project, I followed along with a tutorial done by 365 Data Science on their Udemy course 'The Data Science Course 2020: Complete Data Science Bootcamp.' The project takes in data that highlights whether a person was absent from work or not and includes a number of data points for that individual. A pre-processing, a logistic regression algorithm is applied to get predictions of absenteeism on new data, and the results are visualised in tableau.
